    <h1>My first hardest dream I have experienced</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">I really got heartbroken to this dream happened in 4/11/2025</p>

    <div class="dream">
        <p>I got to sleep at 9.30PM. i always listen to songs before going to bed. I listened to the song "Glimpse of us". I turned off the music and i slept. At approximately 1AM at night, i got a dream. My friend said love is just for 3 monts and it's over. I said to him that "I love her forever". and also i texted him that I will also rip my heart and i will give her. As I said, i made him a video call with a knife holding. He attends and i started to stab my heart and when i touched my heart to rip it off, i woke up at 1AM. i drank water and i slept like nothing had happened. after sleeping, i had the same dream, but after my death, all crying except "THE ONE". i regret that dream, I thought like I wanna die. But that was the greatest and heartbreaking moment in this dream</p>
